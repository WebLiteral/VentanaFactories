<h2>About.</h2>

<p>I make things.</p>

<h3>What happened to the old site?</h3>

<p>It was too complex and painful to maintain. For now I am focusing on functionality and back-end. If you need pretty graphics to catch your attention at all times, this website may be too avant-garde for your taste and I would recommend TickTocks as an alternative.</p>

<h3>Can I use your art in _______?</h3>

<p>As long as your use isnt monetary, you're free to use any of my work in profile pictures, videos, remixes, etc. If unsure, then probably best not to.</p>
